The purpose of this program is to be similar to LinkedIn, allowing users to place job positions on a map and view people's work experiences at those job positions. Initially, all visible information (companies, work experiences) is intended to be public.

The program also includes a timeline component. When a company is clicked, the timeline shows the people who have worked there, or if a person is selected, it shows their work experiences across different job positions.

The application aims to include a feed similar to LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms, displaying posts, messages, etc., from people who are friends or connected with each other. There will also be an option for private conversations between individuals or even group chats.

The repository also contains a client started with Vue (web-client folder), but development has currently shifted to React. I may continue with the Vue client someday.
